          <MainText> Every year. thousands of Children start the Swiss School system. As we all know, The Thek is an integral
              part of the process. Choosing the right bag is no easy task and this is where Thek-friends can help.
              We would like to reduce the waste of unused and unloved Theks and give them a new home. Please join us:  
              Become a Thek-friend and benefit from the Community.
